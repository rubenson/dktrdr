		  Appl. Stat. (2008b) 2 176--196] critiqued OLS regression
		  adjustment of estimated treat- ment effects in randomized
		  experiments, using Neyman's model for random- ization
		  inference. This paper argues that in sufficiently large
		  samples, the sta- tistical problems he raised are either
		  minor or easily fixed. OLS adjustment improves or does not
		  hurt asymptotic precision when the regression includes a
		  full set of treatment-covariate interactions.
		  Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be
		  constructed with the Huber-White sandwich standard error
		  estimator. Even the traditional OLS adjustment has benign
		  large-sample prop- erties when subjects are randomly
		  assigned to two groups of equal size. The strongest reasons
		  to support Freedman's preference for unadjusted estimates
		  are transparency and the dangers of specification search.

	Abstract = {The authors explore the relationship between long-term black empowerment and racial turnout rates in Atlanta (Georgia), Cleveland (Ohio), and Los Angeles (California). Symbolic politics, intergroup competition, and political alienation theories are used to explain interracial differences in political participation in mayoral elections. Strong and durable symbolic effects are evident in all three cases. Black turnout equals or exceeds white turnout during and, in the case of Cleveland, after the period of black empowerment. In Los Angeles, however, the symbolic benefits of black empowerment eventually wane as a result of increasing political alienation among black voters.},

	Abstract = {Activists and scholars argue that the election and presence of Black mayors increase Black political engagement; however, later research suggests that this diminishes over time. Furthermore, a body of research suggests that homogenous racial contexts and contextual poverty decrease political participation. In this article, we ask one question: How does demographic context and length of Black mayoral tenure influence Black political participation? Using a national data set of Black respondents, we find that participation increases as cities become ``Blacker.'' However, simultaneously we find diminishing returns to Black political empowerment, particularly compared with new Black empowerment contexts.},

@article{Washington,
	Abstract = {Both Black and White voter turnout increases 2--3 percentage points with each Black Democrat on the ballot. Given the groups' representations in the population, the White response is numerically greater. Whites of both parties are less likely to vote for their parties' candidate when s/he is Black. The turnout findings are not explained away by voter, election, or politician characteristics. However, the fact that there is no turnout response to Black Republicans suggests that a perception of Blacks' ideology may be a factor.},

@article{SpenceEtAl,
	Abstract = {Testing the proposition that electing black mayors has a positive effect on black political participation, scholars found that black incorporation historically lead to increased black political engagement. However, the research that examines whether length of mayoral tenure influences black political participation is limited. We test this proposition using the 1993---1994 National Black Politics Study. Our findings suggest long-term political incorporation decreases local black political participation while it increases voting for President. However, as the black population percentage of a city rises, local black political participation increases. These findings extend the research on the effect of political incorporation on participation by considering political and demographic context and by engaging in intraracial rather than interracial comparisons.},

Findings about parental influence based on youth coming of age in the 1990s strongly parallel those based on youth socialized in the 1960s. As expected on the basis of social learning theory, children are more likely to adopt their parents' political orientations if the family is highly politicized and if the parents provide consistent cues over time. The direct transmission model is robust, as it withstands an extensive set of controls. Early acquisition of parental characteristics influences the subsequent nature of adult political development.},

	Abstract = {The propensity score is the conditional probability of
		  assignment to a particular treatment given a vector of
		  observed covariates. Both large and small sample theory
		  show that adjustment for the scalar propensity score is
		  sufficient to remove bias due to all observed covariates.
		  Applications include: (i) matched sampling on the
		  univariate propensity score, which is a generalization of
		  discriminant matching, (ii) multivariate adjustment by
		  subclassification on the propensity score where the same
		  subclasses are used to estimate treatment effects for all
		  outcome variables and in all subpopulations, and (iii)
		  visual representation of multivariate covariance adjustment
		  by a two-dimensional plot.},

	Abstract = {A program of research is described that was designed to provide experimental evidence for or against the existence of human altruism. The research tested the empathy-altruism hypothesis-which claims that empathic feelings for a person in need evoke altruistic motivation to relieve that need-against egoistic alternatives. Over 25 experiments have been conducted. With remarkable consistency, results of these experiments conform to the predictions of the empathy-altruism hypothesis. There seems no plausible egoistic explanation for these results. It is tentatively concluded that the empathy-altruism hypothesis is true. More generally, it is suggested that experimental techniques employing deception, developed by social psychologists, may be ideally suited to answering value-laden questions about human nature raised by moral philosophers.},

	Abstract = {The connection between the individual and his or her aggregate geographic environment, usually defined as the neighborhood, is a key component of the contextual model of social influence. However, there is substantial anecdotal evidence that people have very little knowledge or connection to their neighborhood. In this article, the authors explore the connection by using data from the South Bend Study to answer two questions: What do people know about objective conditions of their neighborhoods? Second, do these conditions influence perceptions people have of their neighborhoods?The authors find that (a) people have a good deal of knowledge about the objective conditions, and (b) even after controlling for individual factors, these conditions positively influence how people perceive their status within the neighborhood. In short, there is a connection between the individual and the geographic context.

Private giving represents more than 2% of total gross domestic product (GDP) and is a significant factor in funding the nonprofit sector. This research note documents giving across U.S. states. It adds detailed data and analysis supporting and supplementing research that identifies personal income, capital gains, religious group affiliation, age, volunteerism, and educational attainment as the main factors affecting household giving.

four-time mayor of Boston, used wasteful redistribution to his poor
Irish constituents and incendiary rhetoric to encourage richer
citizens to emigrate from Boston, thereby shaping the electorate in
his favor. As a consequence, Boston stagnated, but Curley kept
winning elections. We present a model of using redistributive
politics to shape the electorate, and show that this model yields a
number of predictions opposite from the more standard frameworks of
political competition, yet consistent with empirical evidence. },

	Abstract = {The Current Population
Survey (CPS) Voter Supplement is a premier source of data on turnout
in the United States. A little-known aspect of the survey is that
for a sizable proportion of people, turnout is measured by
proxy--one member of a household reports for another member--rather
than self-reports of having voted. The purpose of this research note
is to investigate how the use of proxy-reported turnout affects
conclusions about the determinants of turnout in America. The
results suggest a generally optimistic assessment. Although
proxy-reported turnout is about 4 percentage points lower than
self-reported turnout, the individual-level correlates of turnout
and interstate turnout differences are mostly similar for the two
measures. },

@article{Huckfeldt_Sprague:92,
	Abstract = {As agents of electoral mobilization, political parties occupy an important role in the social flow of political communication. We address several questions regarding party mobilization efforts. Whom do the parties seek to mobilize? What are the individual and aggregate characteristics and criteria that shape party mobilization efforts? What are the intended and unintended consequences of partisan mobilization, both for individual voters and for the electorate more generally? In answering these questions we make several arguments. First, party efforts at electoral mobilization inevitably depend upon a process of social diffusion and informal persuasion, so that the party canvass serves as a catalyst aimed at stimulating a cascading mobilization process. Second, party mobilization is best seen as being environmentally contingent upon institutional arrangements, locally defined strategic constraints, and partisan divisions within particular electorates.

	Abstract = {Interest in social capital has grown as it has become apparent that it is an important predictor of collective well-being. Recently, attention has shifted to how levels of social capital have changed over time. But better measures are required to test even basic hypotheses such as establishing the direction of causality between the two components of social capital. In the following analysis, I develop macro measures of social capital through the development of longitudinal measures of civic engagement and interpersonal trust. I use these measures to test basic assumptions about social capital. The result is not only the first over time measures of social capital, but also an increase in our understanding of social capital as a macro process with complex causes and effects.

	Abstract = {We address the question of whether class bias in the American electorate has increased since 1964. We analyze the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey and the National Election Studies for seven consecutive presidential elections, 1964-88. Our results show that conclusions regarding changes in class bias are sensitive to which measure of socioeconomic class is used--income, education, or occupation. We argue that income is the appropriate measure since government policies that discriminate based on socioeconomic class are most likely to do so based on income and there are measurement problems associated with using either education or occupation over time. Our analysis shows that there has been almost no change in class bias in the electorate since 1964.},

	Abstract = {While Wolfinger and Rosenstone's (1980) analysis of turnout in presidential elections focused on individual demographic characteristics, several scholars (Patterson and Caldeira 1983; Cox and Munger 1989) have emphasized the importance of state-level systemic variables (e.g., per capita income, party competition, and campaign spending) in predicting turnout. This paper addresses three main questions. First, are individual demographic characteristics as influential in predicting turnout in 1984 as Wolfinger and Rosenstone found they were in 1972? Second, do individual characteristics lessen in importance when systemic factors are controlled for? And, third, to what extent does the effect of individual characteristics vary across different regions? Data on individual demographic characteristics are taken from the Census Bureau's November 1984 Current Population Survey and merged with systemic data. We find that race and sex have become much stronger predictors of turnout than they were in 1972, though education is still the primary determinant of voting. These relationships hold even when systemic variables are included in the turnout model.},

	Abstract = {A recent article by Barry Burden in Political Analysis alerts us to a steadily increasing gap during presidential election years between self-reported turnout in the NES (National Election Studies) and "official turnout" figures based on the voting-age population (VAP), and points to declining response rates as a culprit. Changing the baseline from the VAP to the VEP (voting-eligible population) significantly changes these conclusions, and point to panel effects as a culprit. The rise in the gap was not linear, but it does emerge rather suddenly in 1996. Gaps between NES self-reported turnout and VEP estimates are higher in presidential election years than in off-years, and self-reported turnout is higher among long-term panel participants than among cross-section respondents in multielection panels.

@article{McDonald:03,
	Abstract = {Consumers of the National Election Study (NES) should be concerned if the survey has a bias that is increasing with time. A recent article by Barry Burden claims that for presidential elections, there is an increasing overreport bias, or turnout gap, between the NES turnout rate and the observed turnout rate caused by declining NES response rates. I show that the increasing turnout gap is an artifact of the universes these two turnout rates are based on. Reconciling the two universes shows no systematic increase of the reconciled turnout gap in presidential elections from 1948 to 2000, and furthermore demonstrates that the post-1976 rise in NES response rates (until 2000) is rewarded in a lower turnout gap. In addition, I offer another theory to explain the turnout gap. If respondents have an equal propensity to misreport that they voted when they did not, as turnout declines, the number of nonvoter respondents increases and so does the turnout gap. I show that in multivariate analysis this theory outperforms Burden's response rate driven theory, though neither theory reaches statistical significance.

	Abstract = {Tobit analysis is the appropriate strategy for many sociological problems. Unfortunately, clear procedures for interpreting its coefficients are not available. Using Walton and Ragin's (1991) tobit analysis of austerity protests in debtor nations, I show that tobit coefficients can be decomposed into two effects: (1) an effect representing an increase in the severity of protests in countries that have experienced protests, and (2) an effect representing a change in the probability of experiencing an austerity protest in countries that recorded no protests. Finally, an analogue to a fully-standardized regression coefficient is defined for tobit coefficients. Decomposing tobit coefficients reveals important additional findings that could not be discerned from the ordinary tobit coefficients.},

extends earlier methodological tests of giving and volunteering in
Indiana to a large (N = 4,200) cross-sectional sample collected in
the United States in the fall of 2001. The authors find that the
results are consistent with those found in the earlier analyses,
namely, that longer, more detailed prompts led respondents to recall
giving and volunteering at higher incidence rates (proportion
donating at all or volunteering at all) and at higher levels
(dollars given or hours volunteered) than when compared to survey
methodologies with fewer prompts. },

@article{Snyder_Ting:05,
	Abstract = {We develop a rationale for roll call voting and position-taking in legislatures using a formal model of legislative vote buying and elections. In our model, citizens and an interest group are motivated by policy, while legislators are motivated by holding office. The group may attempt to buy legislators' votes by offering contracts based on their votes. If citizens cannot condition their reelection votes on legislators' roll calls, then in equilibrium the group will buy its ideal policy and most legislators are voted out of office. This is because the group's contract can promise a nonnegligible payment to each legislator only in the event that her vote is pivotal, but also force no legislator to be pivotal. If citizens can condition their votes on legislators' roll calls, then policies are more moderate and more legislators are reelected. Thus an endogenous preference for position-taking arises in a legislature with public roll calls, and both legislators and citizens will prefer such "open" proceedings ex ante. We explore extensions of the basic model and find some circumstances where the incentives to have open proceedings are weaker.

	Abstract = {Although a variety of age-related processes are known to affect rates of political participation over the adult life span, little is known about their interrelationships and relative impact. We set out a theory of life span civic development that focuses on how age-related changes in community attachment, strength of partisanship, church attendance, government responsiveness, family income, and civic competence impinge on voting participation. To test the theory, we estimated the coefficients of a structural equation model using data from nine National Election Studies combined into a large, cross-sectional time series data set. The model specifies the age-related processes and also controls for the effects of a large number of other variables. Overall, about one-half of the age-related increases in voting participation were attributable to these processes.},

	Abstract = {Survey participation, electoral participation, and political interest have been given wide attention in the research literature, but no one so far has combined these three variables in one model. Taking the social isolation-hypothesis as our starting point, we developed a model with one factor, social involvement, as the common factor underlying these three types of participation. We reviewed the literature and concluded that we had to include a second underlying factor: attachment to society. Using a new data set, gathered on the occasion of the 1998 Dutch national elections and including validated voter turnout measures, we were able to test the model. After making some adaptions, we found a model with a satisfactory fit. The results show that, by including social involvement and attachment to society as mediating variables, we can reach much higher levels of explained variances of survey and electoral participation than we can with traditional models. The results also add to our understanding of the relationship between survey and electoral participation and political interest.

Although there is an emerging scholarship on Latinos, much of the work on group consciousness, group identity, and ethnic organizations is based on research on Black Americans. Increasing diversity in the United States brings necessary attention to expanding the model to the politics and participation of other non-White, multiethnic, and immigrant majority communities. Using a new and unique dataset designed to tap the political opinion and behavior of Asian Americans, the authors find that the usefulness of group-based resources for this rapidly expanding and heterogeneous population is contingent on the specific form of the resources and the mode of political participation.

(6) Fiorina (1981) builds his theory from the reward-punishment theory of V.O. Key. (9) "In sum, prospective voting presumes a policy orientation in the electorate, whereas Key's notion of retrospective voting presumes a resul orientation. As a consequenc, prospective voting demands more of the citizen than does retrospective voting, and prospective voting invests more of the the citizen than does retrospective voting." (11) Retrospective voting is a good thing because it enforces accountability.},

	Review = {(4) They see pid as akin to a religious identification, a view "which hearkens back to earlier social-psychological perspectives on partisanship." (7) Green, Palmquist and Schickler (2002) disagree with the view in the American Voter that partisans are incapable of absorbing discordant information. (15) They note that the gap in presidential support between partisans of different parties is as wide as ever. (19) They note the extent to which pid predicts vote in Congressional elections and they do this as a way of showing that pid matters. (21) Note the fluidity of parties in the Italian case as a constrast to the stability of the American case. (27) They cite Gregory Markus (1982) who argues that the causal arrows between pid and policy prefs flow in both directions. As they note: "On the one hand, citizens occasionally drift toward parties that take ideologically appealing stances on the issues of the day. On the other hand, parties also instruct partisan supporters on how right-thinking Democrats or Repubicans view these issues." (31) They note that while pid is correlated with vote choice, "...but this relationship is far from exact. Party attachments are more than mere summaries of momentary vote intentions. Moreover, voting and partisanship look very different when traced over time. Votes can swing markedly from one election to the next without changing the distribution of partisan attachments." The first point shows the problem of pid working too well, even though they used the effectiveness of pid earlier to establish it's importances. And the second point would only disprove the pid as vote argument in the case where everyone was a strong partisan, where the electoral swing couldn't be accounted for by non-partisans, as of course it can in the real world. (35) They discuss the problem of error in attempts to demonstrate partisan instability -- it's not actualy instability, they argue, just measurement error. Response: measurement error, on the whole, has the effect of biasing the results toward instability, but only because the effect of randomness in the direction of instability outweights the effects of randomenss in the direction of stability. [prove this] But it would not be possible to account for this measurement error by attempting to remove only its effects in the direction of instability. By measurement error, some respondents will look like durable partisans when, in fact, they are not. (52) "Our central hypothesis is that partisan self-conceptions much more closely resemble ethnic or religions self-conceptions that they do evaluations of political leaders, opinions about party platforms, or vote intentions." (53) A lengthy discussion of the importance of measurement, including the murky measures of issue positions, and problems associated with the effect of the number of categories in the variable for measures of correlation of answers to the same question at different points in time. "Before we may compare the stability of partisanship with the stability of other attitudes, we must devise a way to assess stability that does not depend on the accuracy with which attitudes are measured." (55-7) A very elegant formal representation of the different views re: partisanship, esp. the "tethered partisan" model vs. the "running tally" model. That said, the running tally model does not to be especially well represented here, insofar as new evaluations are presented as if they shift partisanship strongly and permanently in this model, when its almost certainly the case, from a Bayesian perspective, that they do not. (62) They address the question of whether pid may be weaker for some people than for others. They argue that neither Zaller's nor Converse's argument are supported in their work. "Across an array of different subgroups, the following generalization appears to hold: Partisan attachments waver around an indivdiual's long-term mean." (65) "On balance, the results presented in Table 3.3 suggest that presidential approval shapes party identification in the short run but that the effects dissipate quickly." Presidential approval may change pid, but pid "snaps back" to its original position once presidential ratings return to normal. (67-9) A discussion of why observed correlations overstates the degree of change in partisanship. (71) "It should be emphasized, however, that small changes in underlying party attachments do tend to add up over time. Although they are scarcely noticeable during the course of a campaign, these changes can produce substantial change over several decades. A two-year correlation of 0.95 implies a theirty-two-year correlation of .44. Although a correlation of .44 is still considerable, it does mean that many partisans will change their identites over the course of their adult lives. Our view is not that partisan identies are immutable bur tather that they change gradually and for reasons that are not directly connected to political events....parrtisan change often seems to spring from changes in a person's immediate environment--where they live and with whom they interact. Unfotunately, from a research standpoint, these social influences typically go unmeasured in political surveys." (71)They note the possibility that partisanship reflects enduring ideological convictions. They attempt to test this by comparing the stability of pid to the stability of party affect. They argue that if pid is simply a shortcut, as rat choicers contend, or if it is simply a reflection of preferences, as dems contend, then pid should vary with affect. They find that affect sometimes changes but pid remains stable--the affect changed, but the identity remained the same. The problem here is that they measure affect with the thermometer rating, which is a poor proxy for the extent to which ideology impacts pid. (80) On the longevity of partisanship: "It seems clear that coalitions formed in one era may shape party attachments many years later, even after the coalitions and the politicians who forged them have passed away. Because these goegraphic patterns sometimes last longer than indvidual's polical lifetime, it is natural to suppose that party attachments are handed down from one generation to the next." (82) Sears et al., apparently, refer to pid as a symbolic attachment acquired in pre-adult socialization and with no policy motivations behind it. Green et al. reject this. They note that the impact of partental pid on kids fades substantially as the kids get older, esp. compared to say religion. (83) "Two broad propositions seem consistent with the available data. First, party identification and most other social identities are highly stable over time. There are of course exceptions. We have seen that certain tehnic groups represent very weak objects of identification, adn the same is undoubtedly true of groups such as yuppies or the underclass, which exist solely as abstract social categories, hae no internal structure as groups, and lack the wherewithal to mobilize their members. Partisan groups are quite different, because partisans comprise teams that compete against one another in an effort to control the state. Although not as organized as relgious groups or as embedded in daily life as class groups, partisan groups nonetheless represent vivid points of social orientation for the electorate. Even people who do not identify with partisan groups know enough about them to recognize that they do not view them as objects of attachment. Second, social identifications such as party attachments are more enduring than evaluations of organizations or people." (86) Green et al. (2002) note that 92% of dems voted for gore compared to only 8% of reps. My question is whehter error, which they make so much about earlier, is not taken into account. Without error, the proportion of Dems voting for Gore would have been even larger. (88) Macropartisanship is defined by MacKuen Erikson and Stimson (1989) as the proporton of dems divided by the percentage of dems and reps. Green et al. note that this definition has two consequences: first, it omits independents, and second, it magnifies small changes b/c it is the ratio of percentages. (91) Wow! The Figure on p.91 shows a very clear decline in democrats during the late80s onward. This is discussed again on p.95. (92-93) They suggest generational replacement as potential explanation for the change in macropartisanship. (93) Partisanship is a retrospective running tally, according to Fiorina (1988). (93) Partisanship is a propsective evaluation , according to Achen (1992). (96) A very clear discussion of a regression equation with a lagged DV. (97) In their model, discussed above, the autoregressive parameter is bounded between 0 and 1. The parameter is .92, which is damn close to 1. They use this parameter as evidence that macropartisanshp returns to its average levels, by multiplying the value of .92 by raising the value to a power comensurate with the number of months in a presential terms, arguing that .92^16 is only 26%, thus suggesting that only 26% of the disturbance would remain after one presidential term. I have three questions. First, would error not suppress the magnitude of this coefficient, certainly away from 1 which would suggest perfection? Second, if macropartisanship was measured at different intervals, say in years rather than months, then would it return an estimate that it took 16 years, rather than 16 months, for all but 26% of a disturbance to dissipate. Third, this analysis is generated over a very long period of time, in which there appear to be periods of stability and then periods of permanent change. Does this analysis not conflate both, thus suppressing the autoregressive paramater below 1, and thus guaranteeing a return to baseline values when multiplying the fraction over and over again for each month? This analysis really seems to be biased against finding long-term permanent change, despite the obvious change that has peristed for some 30 years in the graph. (102) Excellent graph on p102 which shows first, that dem partisanship is at all times lows, and second, that the forcasts generated from models of econ performance and presidential approval are way off in their predictions (overestimate dem support). (106-7) "Although qwe are in general skeptical of ideology-based explanations of party (107) identification, the New Deal represents an instance in which such explanations work. Here was an unusually clear ideological divide between the parties, dramatized again and again as the Republicans denounced relief programs enacted by the Democratic executive and legislature. In the formaive moment when the new party system emerged, and issues such as the scope of government replaced the tariff, it is quite possible that ideological affinity shaped party attachments to an unusual extent." (107) They also note the Italian case, where when a couple of centrist parties disappeared, their supporters moved to other centrist parties, rather than to more extreme parties. (107-8) "Party identification reflects the poliical tenor of the times. The influences of the political environment are most noticeable among new voters, whose partisan (108) attachments often bear teh stamp of the political Zeitgeist that prevailed when they reached voting age or became naturalized citizens." They also note the approval and economy matters, even among older voters, but it isn't a huge effect. (103) Presidential approval is percenage approving, not percentage approving over percentage disapporving, which makes it less susceptible to swings that the measure of pid (Dems over Dem + Rep). Chapter 5: Voter Learning (110) The authors outline the arguments opposed to their social identity conception of partisanship. The first, the "revisionist interpretation," they call it, "...takes issue with the premise that party identification is a form of social identity, arguing instad that party identification reflects assessments about the political parties are likely to deliver when in power...By this account, party identification has little to do with social identities; stable party attachments must come from stable perceptions of what the parties will do in office. For ease of exposition, we will refer to this argument as the revisionist interpretation." A second line of objection, the "biased learning hypothesis," "...derieves from the work of those who first advanced the concept of party identification. These scholars frequently asserted that the stability of partisanship reflects a defensive psychological reaction whereby paritans resist political information that paints their group in a negative light. Party attachment, it is argued, functions as a 'perceptual screen' filtering out news that would disrupt the social bond that links citizens to partisan groups. Thus, it is not simply that people have found a match between their group stereotypes and their self-images; in addition, people avoid or ignore information that fails to correspond to their preconceptions. Let us call this argument the biased learning hypothesis." (111) Partisan ties do not prevent voters from learning, as voters update their information. (111-2) Green et al talk about Fiorina and Downs, and argue that, from their persective, "Identification...has little do with affinity for fellow partisans. Instead, (112) "thinking of onself as a Democrat" is interpreted to mean that one with Democrats ideologically." (113) "Possibly as a consequence of these methodological critiques or simply because of a new fascination with aggregate time-series data, the production of revisionist studies of individual-level partisan change has slowed considerably. A small number of revisionist studies continue to find their way into print, but their analyses of survey data are susceptible to the same methodological objections as those of their forbears. Looking at the literature as a whole, we are aware of no statistical studies that convincingly demonstrate that indviduals' partisan attachments are profoundly influenced by the ebb and flow of political fortunate." Perhaps. But this isn't the essence of the revisionist argument. That argument posits ideology. (117) They describe the kalman filter algorithm, though they appear to explain it quite poorly. (123) After explaining in some detail the notion of Baysian learning, which they characterize as an argument with implications that include that people stop learning at a certain point, Green et al. show that people do seem to respond to current events in their evaluation, but not so much in their partisanship. This suggests that pid is not simply about evals, even though they are treated as equivalent in the Bayesian model. (125) Quoting Campbell et al. (1960, 133) to describe the biased learning hypothesis. Campbell et al say: "identification with a party raises a perceptual screen through which the individual tends to see what is favorable to his partisan orientation" (Campbell et al. 1960: 133). Stokes 1966 (277) also has a number of quotes re: the biased learning hypothesis. (125-6) "This [biased learning] explanation for partisan stability takes issue with the core assumption of the rational learning model--updaing prior views on the baiss of new evidence. This challenge raises a number of empirical questions: Do people assimilate new information in an effecient and unbiased manner; that is, do they update their prior belies in according with Bayes's rule, as in equation 5.3? Or are they selective in the way they gather and absorb news, thereby failing to assign due weight to new information? A Bayesian public may be ignorant or inattentive, but it is not closed-minded." (126) Key point for my inclination: "For example, the often-cited fact that Democrats and REpubicans each tend to declare their party's presidential nominee the more effective debater is not convincing evidence of selective perception because each group of partisans doubtless applies different ideological criteria when evaluating the candidate's ideas. If Republicans like the sound of a cut in the capital gains tax and Democrats do not, they will react differently with the candidates announce their disagreement on this issue. These divergent reactions are not a matter of perceputal bias. Each voter may correctly perceive the candidate's positions on this bissue but react differently, depending on his or her views about such a tax cut." (127) Neat example of how in Bush v. Gore, the Dem judges argues in favour of Gore on states-rights grounds, and the Rep judges argued in favour of Bush on equal protection clause. Evaluations of the court were split on partisan lines, with dems opposing and reps supporting, suggesting that pid, not principle, is what mattered. (127) Green et al. (2002) make the point that experiements which show divergent opinions about events do not establish biased learning. "Partisan differences could refpect perceptual bias, but they could just as well reflect the fact that people draw different conclusions when they start with different initial assumptions." (127-8) Excellent point about research design: "When perceptual bias is being studied, holding tastes constant is a critical component of an effective research design. If in a college dormitory half the students like Mexican cuising and othe other half do not, we would not cite mixed reviews of the lunch menu when tacos are served as evidence of perceptual bias. The issue of perceptual bias hinges on how evaluations change when (128) the same dish is prepared by a gourmet chef; presumably, both those who like and dislike Mexican cuisine should like the food better. Similarly, it is often found that those who engage in risky behaviors such as smoking are more likely than other people to dismuss scientific studies purporting to show the adverse health consequences of these activities. This, too, is consistent with the Bayesian learning model, as groups like smokers and nonsmokers harbor different prior beliefs before encountering the data. The decisive question is how the views of smokers and nonsmokers change after they encouter the new scientific refort. The Bayesian model predicts that both groups will become more concerned about health risks but smokers will remain more skeptial than non-smokers." It his actually what the Bayesian model would predict? I should think that it would predict an effect for young people, but not for old people, for example. (130) Green et al. show that partisans did seem to update their information about the party's ability to manage the economy in light of real events, much as the Bayesian model would suggest and unlike wht the biased learning model would suggest. (131-2) Green et al. show that presidential approval ratings change across time in tandem among all partisans groups, what they call "...a striking demonstration of unbiased learning." (132). Further: "If selective perception is at work, it cannot be detected from the way that partians evaluate the presieenta, which is arguably the most important and widely studies public opinion series in American politics." (132) Another kep point re: my inclination: "Political scientists studying debates have often concluded that they function to reinforce existing partisan propensities. Parties are predisposed to like their party's nominee and agree with what he or she has to say; debates simply provide a forum for reaffirming these preexisting statements. When evaluating who "won" the debate, partians disproportionately back their party's nominee. Again, however, this pattern does not speak unambiguoulsy to the issue of perceptual bias. If liberals and conservatives resonate to different policy proposals, their divergent impressions of who won may simply reflect their different ideological tastes. A more compelling test looks at how assessments change across successive debates, a design that holds constat the ideological appeal of the two candidates." (133) Green et al. examine results of a panel survey of presidential debate watchers of the two debates between Mondal and Reagan, and they note that "Partisans do sympathize with their party's nominee, but they also change their assessments in a matter consistent with unbiased learning." (136-7) "Party identification is a strong predictor of what people think about the parties' economic stewardship, a president's performance in office, or a candidate's performance in a televised debate. Yet when opinion is tracked over time to control for preexisting tastes and beliefs, different partisan groups seem to be similarly influenced by information. This parallel learning process accords with Page and Shapiro's (1992) observation that across a wide array of issues, the opinions of (137) opposing ideological, social, and economic groups seldom polarize over time. It also accords with a good deal of evidence from labratory experiments and studies of media use calling into question the robustness and magnitude of biases attributate to selective exposure and perception (Sears and Whtney 1973, Chaffee and Miyo 1983). Given the speed with which partisan evaluations change and the consistency of these changes across partisan groups, the stability of partisanship is attributable netierh to widespread ignorance nor to perceptual distortion." (137) "Public opinion seems to evolve in an unbiased fashion, and yet party identification responds very gradually, if at all, to sharp changes in political fortune. If identification is more tenacious than a Bayesian learning model would suggest, perhaps the difficulty lies with the way in which scholars such as Downs, Fiorina, and Achen have characterized partisan learning. Following Achen, we have focused entirely on the consequences of observing the parties' performance in office for the purposes of making prospective judgments of performance. Party identification, however, concerns the way in which people think of themselves ("In general, when it comes to politics, do you think of yourself as a Democrat, Republican, Independent, or what?") What matters is one's image of the social groups 'Democrat,' 'Republican," and "Independent', and whether one includes oneself among them. Party performance doubless countributes to the esteem in which partisan groups are held, such that Republicans were a less attractive object of identification in 1964 than 1984, but the fortunes of the Republican party can change without much alterning what comes to mind when people think of rank-and-file Republicans. The stability of partisanship, in other words, may reflect the persistance of citizens' images of Democrats and Republicans." (138) "Given the human penchant for embracing group distinctions, it seems unnecessary and potentially misleading to explain party identification with reference to instrumentalities of various sorts. Suffice it to say that in the process of making sense of themselves and their surroundings, people form self-conceptions that tend to be consonant with their attitudes toward various social groups." **Chapter 6 - Party Realignment in the American South (153) They find that older Southerners changed from Dem to Rep much more slowly, and younger Southerners entered the electorate much more Republican. Youngest respondents were "...unusually responsive to the growing stature of the Republican Party." (153) "The analysis of age cohorts suggests the importance of both initial partisan ites and the process of equilibration by which these initial ties adjust to accomodate new perceptions. If realigment were simply a matter of people finding a party that best suits them ideologically, we would not find younger Southern white sto be sharply more Repubican than their older, often more conservative counterparts. Nor would it be clear why the election in 1964 should produce such a dramatcing reaction at the voting booth, indicating that the electorate was fully aware of and deeply impressed by the differences between the candidates, yet fail to alter Southern party identification. The different trajectories of the three Southern cohorts alerts us to the special role that group images and attachments (154) play in the explanation of Southern realignment. " KEY POINT RE IDEOLOGY: (158-9) "A different interpretation of events places the electorate's ideological tastes, rather than group attachments, in the foreground. Carmines and Stimson (1989) argue that 1964 marked the beginning of a profound partisan division over issues of race and that the Democractic Party's embrace of liberal racial policies drove Southersners into the ranks of the Republican Party. IN a similar vein, one may argue that the left-leaning tendencies of the Democratic Party made it vulnerable to an assortment of conservative attacks, stressing 'family values,' patriotism, and Second Amendment rights. What drove the South into the arms of the Republican Party was not the specter of secular humanists as a group but rather anger over policies that banned prayer in schools, permitted abortion, and denied tax breaks for parochical school tuition. There can be now doubt that these issues were important to Southern voters, and here it is important for us to distance our position from one of the central arguments growing out the American Voter, "The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics,": and Elections and Political Order. In those works, issue voting of the sort envisioned by Downs was downplayed on the grounds that the public had relatively weak opinions, little knowledge about where the parties stand on these issues, and virtually no grase of ideological terms or how to apply them. An exception was carved out for racial issues, but even there the authors were quick to point out [159] that the parties seldom staked out distinctive positions. Believing that issues have little effect on the vote, these authors inferred that issues should have even less effect on deepter attachments such as party identification. Although we tend to assign less weight to issue-based explanations of realignment than many scholoars, it is not because we are skeptical of the pbulic's ability to cast votes on the basis of issues. The success that Democrats continued to enjoy when running for state office attests to the importance of taioloring one's platform to fit the conservative tastes of the electorate, something that Democratic presidential candidates cannot do credibly without jeopardizing the support of the core constituencies. The electorate may lack an appreciation for ideological nuanced an detailed information about what the candidates stand for, but conservative constituences nevertheless tned to elect like-minded public officials. The reasons for this correspondence are several, but perhaps chief among them is the fac tthat campaigns provide cues as to which interest groups are pulling for each side (Brady and Sniderman 1985; Lupia 1994). If a candidate is denounced by the Christian coalition and endorsed by labour unions, voters can infer the candidate's stands on a vareity of issues. Much of what would ordinarily be termed issue voting reflect the importance of group-based cues in shaping political preferences." (159) Despite the above, they do not assign much weight to issue positions driving pid. "A person may chose to vote for candidates on the basis of what they stand for, but a person may identify with a party desbite policy disagreement in the hopes that these tensions will subside." (160) "issue-based realignment and social group-based realignment are thus deeply intertwined." Green et al talk about how people may have switched to the Republicans because of their issue positions, but also because they identify with groups that switched to the Republicans. (161) "The interrelated processes of group perceptions and ideological choice created a new macropartisan equilibrium in the South." (161) "As noted earlier, some of what passes for ideologically based choice of parties is group-based, as people seek out partisan groups that harbor liberals or conservatives, and the growing correlation between liberalism-conservatism and party reflects cohort replacement as older conservative Democrats pass away. But issue-based realigment must be given its due. In the South, the disruptions of the party system created an usual circumstance in which ideological orientations could express themsleves as whites gradually formed new partisan identies." Chapter 7: Partisan Stability outside the United States (165-166) Green et al. mention the Canadian case as an example where pid is not thought to work, even though they disagree with this argument. (168-9) Green et al. reiiterate the point that examinations of switching rates are not necessaritly examples of pid not mattering -- they may also reflect measurement error. (169) "Practical difficulties become more acute as one grapples with the problem of representing party attachments along something other than a unidimensional continuum. Multiparty systems, such as those found in Britain, Germany, Canada, and Italy, potentially give rise to complex partisan identities. These systems feature three and sometimes four or more significant parties. Although these parties can in some cases be arranged along a left-right spectrum, it is unclear whether identification with the various parties can be depicted accurately along a single dimension. It is conceivable that voters may be attracted to different parties for different reasons and identify with more than one party simultaneously. Liberal Party adherents in British Columbia may also identify with the Canadian Alliance (formerly known as the Reform Party), whereas those from Quebec may harbor a degree of psychological attachment to the Bloc Quebecois."},

@article{Kendler2005,
	Abstract = {Context Prior evidence from twin studies suggested genetic moderation
	of the depressogenic effects of stressful life events (SLEs). Can
	the specific genes involved in this effect be identified? Objective
	To replicate and extend a recent study that a functional variant
	in the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) might in part explain these
	findings. Design Characterizing risk for major depression and generalized
	anxiety syndrome in the last year as a function of 5-HTT genotype,
	sex, and the occurrence of SLEs and ratings of the SLE-associated
	level of threat. Setting A population-based sample of adult twins.
	Participants Five hundred forty-nine male and female twins with a
	mean age at participation of 34.9 years (SD 9.1). Main Outcome Measure
	Episodes of major depression and generalized anxiety syndrome in
	the last year with onset measured to the nearest month. Results Individuals
	with 2 short (S) alleles at the 5-HTT locus were more sensitive to
	the depressogenic effects of all SLEs than were those with 1 or 2
	long (L) alleles. When level of SLE-associated threat was examined,
	the interaction between genotype and SLE resulted from an increased
	sensitivity of SS individuals to the depressogenic effects of common
	low-threat events. These events had little impact on risk for those
	possessing the SL and LL genotypes. The 5-HTT genotype did not modify
	the effects of SLEs on risk for generalized anxiety syndrome. Conclusion
	Variation at the 5-HTT moderates the sensitivity of individuals to
	the depressogenic effects of SLEs largely by producing, in SS individuals,
	an increased sensitivity to the impact of mild stressors. Replication
	of these intriguing results is needed.},

	Abstract = {While Wolfinger and Rosenstone's (1980) analysis of turnout in presidential
	elections focused on individual demographic characteristics, several
	scholars (Patterson and Caldeira 1983; Cox and Munger 1989) have
	emphasized the importance of state-level systemic variables (e.g.,
	per capita income, party competition, and campaign spending) in predicting
	turnout. This paper addresses three main questions. First, are individual
	demographic characteristics as influential in predicting turnout
	in 1984 as Wolfinger and Rosenstone found they were in 1972? Second,
	do individual characteristics lessen in importance when systemic
	factors are controlled for? And, third, to what extent does the effect
	of individual characteristics vary across different regions? Data
	on individual demographic characteristics are taken from the Census
	Bureau's November 1984 Current Population Survey and merged with
	systemic data. We find that race and sex have become much stronger
	predictors of turnout than they were in 1972, though education is
	still the primary determinant of voting. These relationships hold
	even when systemic variables are included in the turnout model.},

	Abstract = {We fit a multilevel logistic regression model for the mean of a binary
	response variable conditional on poststratification cells. This approach
	combines the modeling approach often used in small-area estimation
	with the population information used in poststratification (see Gelman
	and Little 1997, Survey Methodology 23:127-135). To validate the
	method, we apply it to U.S. preelection polls for 1988 and 1992,
	poststratified by state, region, and the usual demographic variables.
	We evaluate the model by comparing it to state-level election outcomes.
	The multilevel model outperforms more commonly used models in political
	science. We envision the most important usage of this method to be
	not forecasting elections but estimating public opinion on a variety
	of issues at the state level.},

	Abstract = {This article extends earlier methodological tests of giving and volunteering
	in Indiana to a large (N = 4,200) cross-sectional sample collected
	in the United States in the fall of 2001. The authors find that the
	results are consistent with those found in the earlier analyses,
	namely, that longer, more detailed prompts led respondents to recall
	giving and volunteering at higher incidence rates (proportion donating
	at all or volunteering at all) and at higher levels (dollars given
	or hours volunteered) than when compared to survey methodologies
	with fewer prompts. },

	Abstract = {Although a variety of age-related processes are known to affect rates
	of political participation over the adult life span, little is known
	about their interrelationships and relative impact. We set out a
	theory of life span civic development that focuses on how age-related
	changes in community attachment, strength of partisanship, church
	attendance, government responsiveness, family income, and civic competence
	impinge on voting participation. To test the theory, we estimated
	the coefficients of a structural equation model using data from nine
	National Election Studies combined into a large, cross-sectional
	time series data set. The model specifies the age-related processes
	and also controls for the effects of a large number of other variables.
	Overall, about one-half of the age-related increases in voting participation
	were attributable to these processes.},

	a model with one factor, social involvement, as the common factor
	underlying these three types of participation. We reviewed the literature
	and concluded that we had to include a second underlying factor:
	attachment to society. Using a new data set, gathered on the occasion
	of the 1998 Dutch national elections and including validated voter
	turnout measures, we were able to test the model. After making some
	adaptions, we found a model with a satisfactory fit. The results
	show that, by including social involvement and attachment to society
	as mediating variables, we can reach much higher levels of explained
	variances of survey and electoral participation than we can with
	traditional models. The results also add to our understanding of
	the relationship between survey and electoral participation and political
	interest.},

	Abstract = {This book shows how ordinary Americans imagine their communities and
	the extent to which their communities' boundaries determine who they
	believe should benefit from the government's resources via redistributive
	policies. By contributing extensive empirical analyses to a largely
	theoretical discussion, it highlights the subjective nature of communities
	while confronting the elusive task of pinning down "pictures in people's
	heads." A deeper understanding of people's definitions of their communities
	and how they affect feelings of duties and obligations provides a
	new lens through which to look at diverse societies and the potential
	for both civic solidarity and humanitarian aid. This book analyzes
	three different types of communities and more than eight national
	surveys. Wong finds that the decision to help only those within certain
	borders and ignore the needs of those outside rests, to a certain
	extent, on whether and how people translate their sense of community
	into obligations.
	
	Book Description Based on analysis of three types of communities and
	eight national surveys, this book examines how ordinary Americans
	imagine their communities. Wong concludes that people's definition
	of their community and delineation of its boundaries shape their
	views on governmental redistributive policies.},
